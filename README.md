# Module-3-Python-challenge
In the PyBank challenge, students are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of their company. Students are given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset has two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses."
The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
  Total number of months in the dataset
  Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  Changes in "Profit.Losses" over the entire period, and the average of those changes
  Greatest increase inprofits (date and amount) over the entire period
  Greatest decrease in profits (data and amount) over the entire period
In addition, the final script should print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
In the PyPoll Challenge, students are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
Data is drawn from the file election.data.csv. 
The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 
The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:  
  The total number of votes cast
  A complete list of candidates who received votes
  The percentage of votes each candidate won
  The total number of votes each candidate won
  The winner of the election based on popular vote
